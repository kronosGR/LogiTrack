# Project Summary:
The API system is designed for inventory management and order processing. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete inventory items and orders. The system also includes authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
## Three Key Functionalities:
* Inventory Management: The app allows users to manage inventory items, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting items.
* Order Processing: The app enables users to create and manage orders, including adding and removing items from orders.
* Authentication and Authorization: The app includes authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
## Technologies and Tools:
* ASP.NET Core for building the API
* Entity Framework Core for database operations
* Microsoft Identity for authentication and authorization
* Swagger for API documentation
* IMemoryCache for in-memory caching
